Abused and sold at auction as a slave, I'm suddenly rescued by my father, Duke Henry Wensgrey, the story's original villain. Far from the wicked character I created, he's now a total fool for his daughter. But our relationship isn't the only thing that's changed, and I soon discover that this world isn't anything like what I wrote!\n\n---\nI possessed a character in a novel I had never finished writing when I was in high school. And then now I have the body of a supporting character instead of the main character. It was a seven-year-old orphan girl with no name… Having to suffer the abuse of others, until I got really tired and ran away from that place. But I was captured and sold as a slave. I thought my life was over… But the person who saved me was the novel's most prominent villain, Henriette.\n\nHe treats the emperor like a puppet. A person who has a reputation for being extremely cruel in the original and has a hobby of cutting the throat of aristocrats. …Is he my biological father? But other than that terrible reputation, living with him wasn’t bad either.\n\n\"Okay, my daughter. You can do whatever you want. If you want something, everyone in the family will do what you want.\"\n\nWait… I didn't write a novel like that in the first place?",

First, it was to save Ixion, her unrequited love, who was assassinated and killed. “Prince, I am here to warn you of the assassination that will take place today.” I succeeded in saving him by using information from the original, I just want to live a comfortable life that has nothing to do with the original. Until I received a letter… “I owe you a lot of favors. I hope you will come to the capital immediately because I want to repay this favor with a marriage.” Ixion’s marriage proposal, which I thought was the end of our relationship. “Prince, I didn’t save you so you could propose to me?” Can Elsia peacefully refuse his marriage proposal and return to her comfortable life?",
