Treated as a pawn and puppet by her family, she was used and then discarded only to die from the sideeffects of the drug.\n\nShe thought that was the end, but no: When she opened her eyes again, she had returned to four months earlier, before she had betrayed her husband by order of her family. This was her chance to divorce Cassius, who was forced to marry her, then find a cure for the sideeffects of the drug that had robbed her of her sight and voice but…\n\n\"Is the reason you've been avoiding me all this time just because you're afraid of being discovered?\"\n\nHis purple eyes almost pierced her body, \"It isn't because you hate me?\"\n\nSuddenly his eyes turned red, \"May I come near you now?\"\n\nThen his ears also turned red...\n\n---\nCaught up in her parents' political scheme, Yurania is forced to lose her sight and voice in order to marry Duke Casius Euclid and betray him. After being imprisoned for her treachery and despised by all, she makes one dying wish to turn back time and freely live her own life. When Yurania miraculously awakens mere days before the betrayal, she seizes the opportunity to right everything...only to discover that her past relationships and all that she had known weren't what they seemed.\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%ED%8F%AD%EA%B5%B0-%EB%82%A8%ED%8E%B8%EC%9D%B4-%EC%96%B4%EC%A9%90%EC%A7%80-%EC%A1%B0%EC%8B%A0%ED%95%B4%EC%A1%8C%EB%8B%A4/3088), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/60261871)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [French / Français](https://www.delitoon.com/detail/daf_1000651)\n* [German / Deutsch](https://www.delitoon.de/detail/dad_2000284)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/I-Accidentally-Tamed-the-Duke/745)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/129188)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B9%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%86_%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%A0%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%B6%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B2/595)",
