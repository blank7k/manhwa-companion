    "summary": "After passing out drunk on a cold night, I awake as a nameless young orphan girl. But she's not just any girl, she's a character from a novel I wrote in high school! Abused and sold at auction as a slave, I'm suddenly rescued by my father, Duke Henry Wensgrey, the story's original villain. Far from the wicked character I created, he's now a total fool for his daughter. But our relationship isn't the only thing that's changed, and I soon discover that this world isn't anything like what I wrote!\n\n---\nI possessed a character in a novel I had never finished writing when I was in high school. And then now I have the body of a supporting character instead of the main character. It was a seven-year-old orphan girl with no name… Having to suffer the abuse of others, until I got really tired and ran away from that place. But I was captured and sold as a slave. I thought my life was over… But the person who saved me was the novel's most prominent villain, Henriette.\n\nHe treats the emperor like a puppet. A person who has a reputation for being extremely cruel in the original and has a hobby of cutting the throat of aristocrats. …Is he my biological father? But other than that terrible reputation, living with him wasn’t bad either.\n\n\"Okay, my daughter. You can do whatever you want. If you want something, everyone in the family will do what you want.\"\n\nWait… I didn't write a novel like that in the first place?\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%95%85%EB%8B%B9-%EA%B3%B5%EC%9E%91%EA%B0%80%EC%9D%98-%EC%8B%A4%EC%84%B8-%EB%A7%89%EB%82%B4%EB%94%B8%EC%9E%85%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/3441), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/60083487)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://pdt.tencentac.com/?adtag=appshare.ios.detail%26QQ%26382&contentId=382&platform=IA)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/131595)",

After falling into water unexpectedly, she met the eccentric princess. “Sister, please become a fake obsessive maniac!” Since they were inside this tragic BL novel, the princess wanted her to seduce the bottom male lead instead of the original story’s obsessive maniac to prevent the world’s destruction. She followed the plan and seduced him, acting like an obsessive maniac. However… “Act like you love me. If you don’t, I might just kill the person you love.” The bottom male lead, whom she manipulated and discarded, returned as the Emperor of a new empire. “What do I need to do to have you? War? Massacre?” The original ‘Obsessive Maniac 1’, the enemy empire’s emperor, was truly insane. “With just one kiss from you, I can dedicate everything I have. This heart, this empire.” The childhood friend whom she thought was innocent turned out to be the real ‘Obsessive Maniac 2’ from the original story. For some reason, the obsessive maniacs from the story all come after her.",
