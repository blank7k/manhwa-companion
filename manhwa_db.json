To avoid this, she adopts her ultimate bias, the ruthless Emperor Melkiades, as her father instead.

It would be troublesome to find another woman now, and there is no guarantee that she would do as well as Evangeline.”\n\nFor Dekarno, there was no Duchess better than her.\n\nSo, if it was only about bankruptcy, he could bear with it.\n\nHowever, she couldn’t.\n\n“Let’s put an end to this, now.”\n\n“…Are you suggesting canceling the engagement?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nEvangeline had given up everything she had brought so far and now walked away barehanded.\n\nBy relinquishing everything, she could let go of that man, too.\n\nEven the feelings she had held alone.\n\n“I liked you, Your Grace.”\n\n“….”\n\n“No way. Your Grace didn’t think I was only coveting the position of Duchess, did you?”\n\nHow could she leave so easily after claiming she liked him?

It’s unbearable for a mere human like me to endure.”",
