In the blink of an eye, the old man covers Choi Si-woo with the straw backpack he is carrying. Where Choi Si-woo had stumbled upon was an enormously wide ruined traditional Korean house (hanok).\n\nAt the edge of the spacious courtyard, surrounding him on the courtyard, there were numerous black shadows standing. To the bewildered Choi Si-woo, the old man speaks. Once every 666 years, a ceremony is held to select the king of Yokai and each Yokai in this world possesses one entry ticket for it. And Choi Si-woo is, in fact, a hybrid of a human and a goblin, inheriting the blood of an extinct goblin. Among the goblin folk, only Choi Si-woo possesses the entry ticket. As the sole survivor inheriting the blood of a goblin, the adventure of the half-monster boy, Choi Si-woo, begins.”",

A portion of the galaxy is filled with terraformed worlds inhabited by interstellar traveling human beings. For 150 years two mighty space powers have intermittently warred with each other: the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance. Within the Galactic Empire, based on mid 19th century Prussia, an ambitious military genius, Reinhard von Müsel, later conferred Reinhard von Lohengramm, is rising to power. He is driven by the desire to free his sister Annerose, who was taken by the Kaiser as a concubine. Later, he wants not only to end the corrupt Goldenbaum dynasty but also to defeat the Free Planets Alliance and to unify the whole galaxy under his rule.  \n  \nIn the Free Planets Alliance Star Fleet is another genius, Yang Wen Li. He originally aspired to become a historian through a military academy, and joined the tactical division only out of need for tuition money. He was rapidly promoted to an admiral because he demonstrated excellence in military strategy in a number of decisive battles and conflicts. He becomes the archrival of Reinhard, though they highly respect one another. Unlike Reinhard he is better known for his underdog victories and accomplishments in overcoming seemingly impossible odds and mitigating casualties and damages due to military operations.  \nAs a historian, Yang often predicts the motives behind his enemies and narrates the rich history of his world and comments on it. One of his famous quotes is: \"There are few wars between good and evil; most are between one good and another good.\"  \n  \n\n\n---",
