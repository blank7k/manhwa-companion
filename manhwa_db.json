But I just can't believe that the 'kind' protagonist in the original novel was all an act!\n\n\"If I kill you, this partnership will be broken.\"\n\n\"You can't do that. We'll both die at the same time.\"\n\nWe were tied together by a tightly shared fate. Sharing the same wounds, the same pain, the same life and death. Plus, we had to have physical contact for the symbiosis?\n\nWhen I found out about his mask, he was cruel to me with no hesitation. Unreasonable amounts of work, unreasonable demands… Why can't I be with another man?\n\n\"I've figured it out! How to break this partnership!\"\n\nNow that my life would be safe, all that's left is to get away―\n\n\"I have no intention of breaking it.\"\n\n\"…Pardon?\"\n\n\"Just like you, I'm also curious,\" he held me in his arms and his gaze slowly descended to my lips, \"I'm curious about to what extent our pain will be shared.\"\n\n---\nAs the #1 stalker of Pope Ulysses, the kind male lead, Yoidel was to be executed for her crimes. Just minutes before her end, Yoidel escapes her cell to ask Ulysses for help, only to come across a bloody madman... who turns out to be the male lead himself! In a desperate attempt to survive, Yoidel binds herself to him in a magical contract, dooming the two to share their lives and deaths. Now stuck with a two-faced psycho, will Yoidel find a way to break their bond before it breaks her?",
