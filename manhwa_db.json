Even if everyone in the Imperial Palace were wary of me, they didn’t hate me yet.\n\n‘Let’s not be impudent, and be obedient.’\n\nI obstinately didn’t need nor have the mindset of trying to be loved by the Empress.

It was definitely like that, but–\n\n“Come to my bedchamber tonight. I’ll read you a fairy tale book!”\n\n“P-please don’t cry. I’ll give you this.”\n\nJust why is everyone’s attitude endlessly gentle? I couldn’t understand. And it was baffling.\n\n‘…I don’t need it though?’\n\nI wasn’t really a young kid lacking affection. And that gaze in which they looked at me as if I were the loveliest in the world was extremely uncomfortable. Just where would I use a fairy tale book that’s full of jewels and silk, and the magic pearl which is the Imperial family’s heirloom? Since it’s already been done, I just wish for everyone to get out of my palace.\n\n---\nIn the nation of Seora, Yehwa Aryun is the Empress Regnant, and her court is full of consorts with special powers. The newest member of the imperial court is 8-year-old Sanya Yeoran. And although she has no powers, Sanya actually has the mind of an adult who knows exactly what will happen in this fantasy world, because she already read about it in her past life. Thanks to that, she comes up with a plan to avoid her tragic execution: stay away from Yehwa and her jealous consorts at all costs!",
