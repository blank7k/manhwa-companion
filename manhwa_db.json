We’re not destined to stand under the same sky.”\n\nShe had become Karina Apocalita, the personification of evil and a member of the heterogeneous race that ruled the world with malevolence. The plot began to twist and turn when Karina unknowingly saved the life of Reneiger, a justful knight and the heroine’s first love.\n\nReneiger became doubtful of his faith, eventually losing his glow and radiant platinum blond. Soon the sacred knight fell from grace and aligned himself to Karina’s fate.\n\n“There’s no turning back now. Dear God, please forgive me.”\n\nHe knew he would never be able to escape from her hands.\n\n---\n\"I am a knight of Latem, and that means I cannot coexist under the same sky as you.\"\n\nAfter entering the book *A Trapped Bird Cannot Escape*, I realized that I had taken over the body of Karina Apocalypta, a member of a species that reigns as the evil of the world. However, the novel's plot begins to twist after I saved the life of Reneiger, the first love of the female protagonist, who happens to be a holy knight. Reneiger begins to doubt his faith, ultimately losing his brilliant platinum hair. Thus, the once sacred holy knight turns corrupt and eventually sympathizes with Karina's fate...\n\n\"Now we have each other's desires,\" Karina said while caressing his cheek. It was a feeling of being pulled in by each fascinating tendril of thorny vines.\n\nReneiger couldn't bear it, \"It can't be undone.\"\n\n---\nIn a land overshadowed by darkness, Karina Apocalita rises as a formidable figure, her being a tapestry of power from a diverse race. Her destiny intertwines with Reneiger, a knight from the virtuous Latem order, known for justice and as the former love of a legendary heroine. Their paths take an unforeseen turn when Karina, unaware of her impact, saves Reneiger's life. This act, challenging his convictions, triggers a crisis within him, tarnishing his once radiant aura and precipitating a fall from grace.\n\nFaced with his altered fate, Reneiger prays for forgiveness, realizing his escape from Karina's shadow is but a dream. This pivotal moment raises a haunting question: will Reneiger rediscover the light, or be consumed by the darkness emanating from Karina?",
