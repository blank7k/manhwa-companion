    "summary": "Upon opening my eyes after a bus accident, I found myself in the fantasy world of a web novel I enjoyed reading… the only catch is, I reincarnated twenty years before the novel begins! Reborn as Princess Yerenica of the small Lebovny kingdom, I'm determined to change the future in order to prevent the series of unfortunate events that will soon occur. In the original story, my older sister, Tejavia, is pregnant with the future female lead, when she's suddenly kidnapped by the Belgoat Empire's emperor. But in my desperate attempts to protect her, I got kidnapped instead! And as if that wasn't bad enough, my body is ridiculously weak to magic. But… strangely enough, whenever I'm by the emperor, I feel fine! The only way to save the emperor, who's destined to die at the hands of his own son after marrying the villainess, and save myself from being afflicted by magic… is for us to marry!  \r\n  \r\n\"Marry me, Father.\"  \r\n  \r\n\"'Father?' Princess, I haven't married yet, nor do I have any kids…\"  \r\n\r\n\r\n---",

After her dream to be a magic device researcher was destroyed, the one to save her was her first love, the First Prince Lucius, whom she was able to meet again! From a book club in a secret library to outings to magic device shops, Louise manages to regain the light in her eyes with the time they spend together. With her feeling her heart beat from Lucius's sweet words, just when you'd think they'd get together in no time, the past that the 'substitute lady' doesn't want to be known becomes an obstacle. \n\n“What do you think about this?”\n(No... I couldn't possibly tell him about that.)\n\nOn the other hand, Louise’s potential as a researcher is also starting to bloom...?\n\n---\nLouise, a noble lady who loves reading and researching magic tools, leads a double life pretending to be her twin sister.

As they spend time together reading books in the hidden archives and looking around at different magic tool shops, Louise slowly regains her confidence. On top of that, her heart flutters every time unconsciously sweet words leave the prince's mouth. The mood is perfect and it seems like it's seconds before they can finally be together, but the past she wants to keep hidden gets in the way.\n\n\"How...do you feel about me?\"\n(He asks, but...
