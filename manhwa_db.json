    "summary": "Beatty, a weak squirrel shapeshifter born into a lion family. Because of that, she grew up abused in her aunt's home in the capital. When she told her only friend and fiancé, the Second Prince, that she'd be leaving to realize her dreams–\n\n*\"Ritter, you bastard…!\"*\n\nShe died from his poisonous fangs.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes again, she had returned back to her childhood, to the moment before she got entangled with the Second Prince.\n\nWhat do you need when you're young? Speed. She immediately escaped with just her body and set off to her father, in the Lion Duke's territory.\n\nAlthough she probably wouldn't be welcomed, if they took into consideration the incredible secret, which will only be discovered in the future, which she possessed, then maybe they wouldn't kick her out…\n\n\"Welcome, Milady!:\n\n\"My God! When did you get so tall…?\"\n\n\"Milady's walking on those cute little feet!\"\n\n…Huh? Why are they welcoming her like this? Is that really her statue?\n\n---\nWhen squirrel-shifter Beaty Aslan tells her fiancé, Prince Retter, that she plans to flee her abusive aunt, he unexpectedly kills her with his snake fangs. Upon opening her eyes, she finds herself in the past, before she met that rotten prince. With her knowledge of the future, she sets off to her father's duchy to strike a deal and change her fate, but is surprised to find her lion family welcoming her with open arms.
