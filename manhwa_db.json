Leopin and his friends entered the Royal Pioneer Academy. However, during the \"Ritual of Ability Development\" at the entrance ceremony, the status given to Leopin was disastrous.\n\n\"Occupation: Unemployed.\"\n\"All statuses except dexterity remain at their initial values and do not grow.\"\n\"Skill is dexterous, master of none.\"\n\nLeopin's classmates exiled him because he had nothing to offer other than his dexterity. Leopin is placed in the \"Special Training Class\", a class for failures. Leopin is left all alone. However, he realizes that the skill he has been given, \"Poor Dexterity,\" has an unexpected performance. That is...\n\nYou can convert your dexterity status to any other status.\nYou can change your occupation to any one you want.\n\nThe first thing Leopin did was to become a lumberjack. First, Leopin changed his job to \"Lumberjack\" to get wood from the forest. He then became a carpenter and built the most magnificent house of all. He became an Appraiser to identify rare items, and a Battle Axe User to fight off students from other classes who tried to attack him. Become a Ranger to explore dungeons and a Ninja to get through traps with ease. Leopin, alone (solo), had gained enough power to do everything.\n\nAs Leopin continues to be a warrior, he is adored by his childhood friend, a saint, and admired by a beautiful alchemist, and his activities become even more well known. On the other hand, the classmates who expelled Leopin regret their decision to do so when they witness Leopin's abilities. Their home remains a shack, they are unable to explore, and they gradually lose their place in the school and are ruined.\n___\n**Explanation:** the skill is not \"poor dexterity\", but \"dexterous poor\", which is the Japanese equivalent to a Jack of all trades, master of none; since they can do a bit of everything, they are \"dexterous\", but since they have mastered none, they supposedly cannot make a living from it, hence they are \"poor\". Another manner of saying you have high dexterity is to be \"handy\", back-translated from DEX as in *manual* dexterity from early RPGs. \"An unemployed handyman who does a bit of everything\" just doesn't quite roll off the tongue.",

    "summary": "She possessed a villainess who is known and hated for her evil acts in an unpopular novel. But because of her personality, it was extremely difficult for her to play the villainess role. But not for long…\n\n“I’ll fix your dress according to your taste this instant!”\n\n“My request.”\n\n“O-Of course! As per your request, there’s only one piece available in the whole Empire.”\n\nPeople around me listen to me well even if I just frown and sit still. Since I don’t have to live in difficulty, I decided to just comfortably live on as a villainess.\n\n“Father. Is it necessary for you to solve formulas in this slow and inefficient way?”\n\nI thought it would be good to be a rich villainess, so I used all my knowledge.\n\n“Why don’t you give me the honor of escorting the Princess?”\n\nI have had enough of dealing with my father, so why did an unexpected character suddenly appear? What if this person disrupts my plan?\n\n---\nDohee lived as a pushover, died miserably, and was reborn in a novel as a notorious villainess. But it turns out that her new life is not without its perks, as Deborah Seymour is also the richest villain alive. Now, all that's left for her to do is lay low and enjoy her carefree lifestyle...if not for the fact that Deborah is fated to be sent to a monastery! Will this ex-doormat find a way to avoid yet another tragic ending, or will the challenges of being a villainess be too much for her?\n\n---\n**Links:**\n\n**Original Novel:** [Korean / 한국어](https://page.kakao.com/content/55527274), [English](https://tapas.io/series/the-perks-of-being-a-villainess-novel/info)\n\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%95%85%EB%85%80%EB%9D%BC%EC%84%9C-%ED%8E%B8%ED%95%98%EA%B3%A0-%EC%A2%8B%EC%9D%80%EB%8D%B0%EC%9A%94/3100), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/60728286)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/the-perks-of-being-a-villainess/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://pdt.tencentac.com/?adtag=appshare.ios.detail%26QQ%26404&contentId=404&platform=IA)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E7%95%B6%E5%80%8B%E6%83%A1%E5%A5%B3%E8%BC%95%E9%AC%86%E5%8F%88%E6%84%89%E5%BF%AB/446)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/The-Perks-of-Being-a-Villainess/656)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/134441)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9B%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B0/509)",
