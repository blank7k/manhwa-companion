The future of a woman in the slums is bleak at best, so Lynx is ready for an out. She’s about to be sold off to a senile old man when she’s rescued by a noblewoman who looks just like herself. Claiming to be her older twin sister, Heeyun Joo asks her for a startling favor: to pose as her… or else.\n\n---\n[Original Webtoon](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=53648484)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* English: [COPIN](https://copincomics.com/toon/363), [Pocket Comics](https://www.pocketcomics.com/comic/1857), [NetComics](https://www.netcomics.com/comic/17330), [Tappytoon](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/the-13th-night)",
